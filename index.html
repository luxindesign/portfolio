			Let me introduce myself, I'm Théo DOS SANTOS, aka <strong>Lux</strong>, I live in a small town near Rouen, France and I'll be 22 in April.<br>
			I have always loved  graphic design and illustration since I was very young, thanks to my brother who actually work as an Artistic Director.<br>
			I'm currently studying at the university of Rouen in the multimedia and internet professions department. This course allows me to learn about webdesign, programming languages, audiovisual techniques, graphics design, visual artistry and many other subjects. Thanks to this graduation I'll be very versatile and get basics skills everywhere but I really want to specialize myself in graphic design.<br>
			During my free time I do photo montage, custom typography and also poster design. If you're interested in seeing my work, please check by clicking on my <a href="work.html"><strong>work</strong></a> tab. You can also check it on my social media, you'll find links on my <a href="contact.html"><strong>contact</strong></a> tab.
			If you want to support me, don’t hestitate to follow me !<br> Every week, I post design and share contents that inspires me.<br><br>
			Thanks for your attention.<br><br>
			You can contact me for commission or collaboration by mail or on social media.
